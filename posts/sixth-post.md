The Canary Islands sit more than 1,000 miles from mainland Spain â€“ but as your ship docks at the largest island, Tenerife, you'll feel like you've entered another world. Exploring the island's diverse nature will reinforce this: The landscape here ranges from to deserts to dense forests to spectacular beaches. Cool off in the Bajamar natural salt-water pools, or go scuba-diving among octopus and barracudas in Tabaiba. When you're tired out from your adventure, head to a seaside restaurant for a glass of sangria and crusty bread slathered with almagrote, a local hard-cheese spread flavored with tomato, garlic and paprika.
